# Biscuit Documentation

Documentation website generated with [typedoc](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc) for the [biscuit library](https://github.com/oasisjs/biscuit).

## Build

Using commands in the `Makefile`:

```bash
	make build
```

**Recommended:** `make update` before `make build` to ensure that the latest version of the library is used. Also, once the changes to the `docs/` folder are generated, it's preferable that they're sent in a single "Build" (or similar) commit, separated from the rest of the changes.
